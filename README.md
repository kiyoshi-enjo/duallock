# 🖼️ chitr

**A smart terminal tool to open images, videos, and audio files — quickly and easily.**

`chitr` is a lightweight media opener for your terminal that automatically detects whether a file is an **image, video, or audio** — by reading its actual content, not just the extension — then opens it using the best available application.

If the preferred application isn't installed or fails to open the file, `chitr` automatically falls back to another compatible application.

**No guessing. No complicated configuration. Just open your media.**

## ✨ Features

* 🔍 **Automatic File Detection**
  Detects images, videos, and audio using the `file` command (real content, not just the extension) — falls back to extension matching only if `file` isn't available.

* 🖥️ **GUI & Terminal Support**
  Choose between graphical applications and terminal-based viewers/players, presented in a clean, colorful selection menu every time — no assumptions carried over from your last choice.

* 🔄 **Smart Fallback System**
  If one application fails, `chitr` automatically tries another compatible application. Known quirks (like `mpv`'s harmless EOF exit code, or `ffplay`'s multi-Ctrl+C hard-exit code) are recognized so a real stop is never mistaken for a crash.

* 🐚 **Bash, Zsh & Fish Support**
  `chitr` runs natively in all three shells — each with a dedicated, purpose-built version (not a compatibility shim), since the three shells differ enough (hooks, array semantics) that a single script can't cover all of them.

* 🍎 **macOS Support**
  Detects macOS automatically, prioritizes native apps (**Preview**, **QuickTime Player**), and uses Homebrew for installing anything else.

* ⌨️ **Shell Integration**
  With shell integration enabled, you can simply type a media filename and let `chitr` handle the rest. The explicit `chitr <file>` command always works too, regardless of shell hook conflicts.

* 📦 **One-Line Install**
  A single installer detects which shell(s) you actually have and downloads only the file(s) you need — nothing you won't use.

* 📋 **Application Manager**
  Use `--list` to see which supported applications are installed and which are missing, across all three media types.

* ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast**
  No heavy dependencies, no background services.

# 🚀 Installation

## Quick Install (recommended)

This single command detects which shell(s) are installed on your system (Bash, Zsh, and/or Fish) and downloads **only** the matching file(s) — not all three:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiyoshi-enjo/chitr/main/install.sh | bash
```

It will:
- Detect Bash / Zsh / Fish on your system
- Download only the relevant script(s) to your home directory
- Wire them into the correct shell config (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `config.fish`)
- Make them executable

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
chitr --setup
```

This installs a solid default toolkit (`jp2a`, `chafa`, `cacaview` for images; `mpv` for video/audio).

---

## Manual Install (git clone)

If you'd rather inspect the code first or don't want to pipe `curl` into `bash`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiyoshi-enjo/chitr.git
cd chitr
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` runs the same shell-detection logic locally instead of over the network — same result, no download step.

### Installing Git, if you don't have it

| Distro | Command |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu / Debian / Mint | `sudo apt install git -y` |
| Fedora / RHEL / Rocky / Alma | `sudo dnf install git -y` |
| Arch / Manjaro / EndeavourOS | `sudo pacman -Sy git` |
| openSUSE | `sudo zypper install git` |
| Alpine | `sudo apk add git` |
| macOS | `brew install git` |

---

## macOS Notes

macOS ships an old default Bash (3.2) that `chitr` can't run on. If you use Bash on Mac:

```bash
brew install bash
```

If you use Zsh (the default shell on modern macOS), no extra step is needed — `chitr`'s Zsh version works out of the box once installed.

🎉 **That's it! chitr is ready to use.**

## 📦 Usage

### Open a File

```bash
chitr photo.jpg
chitr video.mp4
chitr song.mp3
```

Or, with shell integration, just type the filename directly:

```bash
photo.jpg
video.mp4
song.mp3
```

`chitr` automatically determines the file type and shows a menu:

```
🖼  Image detected: photo.jpg

╭──────────────────────────────────╮
│  1) GUI  =  In App                │
│  2) CLI  =  In Trmnl              │
╰──────────────────────────────────╯
Choose [1/2]:
```

### Available Commands

```bash
chitr --setup
```
Install recommended default applications.

```bash
chitr --list
```
Show installed and missing applications, by category.

```bash
chitr --help
```
Show the help menu.

---

## ⌨️ Shell Integration

Once installed, you can open a media file directly by typing its filename — no `chitr` prefix needed:

```bash
$ photo.jpg
```

This works in **Bash, Zsh, and Fish**. A couple of notes depending on your shell:

- **Bash / Zsh:** if something else on your system (like the `command-not-found` package on Debian/Ubuntu/Kali) also hooks into unknown commands, `chitr` automatically re-asserts itself before every prompt, so this keeps working regardless of load order.
- **Fish:** typing a bare filename works, but fish will also print its own harmless "command not found" message afterward — this is a fish design limitation (its hook doesn't fully suppress the default message), not a chitr bug. It only affects the bare-filename shortcut.

If you ever run into any issue with the bare-filename shortcut in any shell, `chitr <file>` always works as a guaranteed fallback.

```

Each shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish) runs its own dedicated implementation of this flow — the logic is equivalent, but hooks, arrays, and syntax are native to each shell rather than emulated.
